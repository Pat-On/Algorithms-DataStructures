            Backtracking is solving similar problems to dynamic programing,

                the key difference is that backtracking need to:

                    Return ALL solutions
                            or
                    Return a VALID solution amongst all solutions

            Create a function that solves for any 9x9 sudoku puzzle given.

                Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.

                Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.

                Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.


        Step 1: Verify the constraints

            What happens if the board cannot be solved?
                - Leave the sudoku puzzle as is.

        Step 2: Write out some test cases

            because the examples are time consuming
            you may think about base case
            and some examples that are invalid
