                2-D Arrays Approach

                row    --                 --
            0  | [x, x, x, x, x, x] |               6 x 6 
            1  | [x, x, x, x, x, x] |
            2  | [x, x, x, x, x, x] |
            3  | [x, x, x, x, x, x] |
            4  | [x, x, x, x, x, x] |
            5  | [x, x, x, x, x, x] |
            --                  --

    Values follow to patterns
        - limited (very specific values example A B C)

        - unlimited (can be practically anything)

    
    We have DFS and BFS in 2-D arrays to. 

    Sequential order:
        from left to right
        to the begging of other line
        from left to right



    ----------------- Limited Values -----------------


    IS there a relationship between the values
        - in our example between start and end there is relationship:
            + we need to get from start to end
        - there is relationship between green and blue values which are walls and you cannot cross them

    Is there repeated subproblem that repeated would solve the problem in general4
        - example: 
            + we can solve the problem for only one element start
