                Objectives

- Define what dynamic programming is
- explain what overlapping subproblems are
- understand what optimal substructure is
- solve more challenging problems using dynamic programming


                Definition
A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into
a collection of simples subproblems, solving each of those subproblems 
just once and storing their solutions

                Where does the name come from?

term used to describe the process of solving problems where one need to find the best decisions one after another.

            It only works on problems with...
        Optimal Substructure and Overlaping Subproblems

Overlapping subproblems - a problem is said to have ovelapping subproblems
                            if it can be broken down into subproblems
                            which are reused several times

            example:
                    Fibonacci sequence: Every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones
                    1 + 2 = 3 
                    2 + 3 = 5 
                    3 + 5 = 8 
                    etc...

Optimal Substructure - a problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution 
                        can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
