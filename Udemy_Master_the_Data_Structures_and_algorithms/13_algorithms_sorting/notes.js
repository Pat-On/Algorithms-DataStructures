Comparision Sorts: (BIG O ( n log n )) You can not make it better because mathematically it is impossible

        Elementary sorts:
            - Bubble Sort
                - biggest number is bubbling up to the top
                - O(2n) time complexity 
                - 0(1) space complexity
            - Insertion Sort
            - Selection Sort



        Complex sorts:
            - Merge Sort(n log n) one of the most efficient algorithms in sorting arrays
                - it is stable algorithm because it would keep original order in case of the same values
            - Quick Sort (n log n)


Non-Comparision Sort - We are usingapproach how data is stored on our computer - it pretty complex - more resources video 186 plus previous course!
    Interesting!!!!!
    These algorithms working only in restricted range of only integers <-- important! 
    fix lenghts integers! 

        Sum - specific range of integer it may be faster, but some people disagree to it! 



            Counting Sort
            Radix Sort
            Bucket Sort
