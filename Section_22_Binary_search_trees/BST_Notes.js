                    Objectives

- Define what a tree is
- Compare and contrast trees and lists
- Explain the differences between trees, binary trees, and binary search trees
- Implement operations on binary search trees

                    What is a tree
A data structure that consist of nodes in a parent / child relationship



        Lists - Linear
        Trees - nonlinear


                    Tree Terminology

- Root - the top node in a tree
- Child - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
- Parent - The converse notion of a child
- Siblings - A group of nodes with the same parent
- Leaf - a node without child
- Edge - The connection between one node and another

===========================================================

                    Lots of different applications!

- HTML DOM
- Network Routing
- Abstract Syntax Tree
- Artificial Intelligence
- Folders in Operating Systems
- Computer File System
- JSON file is tree like structure - interesting (parent child relation)


===========================================================

                    Kinds of trees

- Trees (general)
    
    - Binary Trees
        Rule : Binary Tree can have only 0 - 1 - 2 children
        
        - Binary Search Trees
            Quick in searching
            Kept in order
            Storing data which can be compared in some way


                    How BSTS WORK

- Every parent node has at most two children 
- Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent

less than 41        41        More than 41
            20              65
        11      29      50      91
            12      32        72    99
