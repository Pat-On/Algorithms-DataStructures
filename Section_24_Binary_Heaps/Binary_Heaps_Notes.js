                    Binary Heaps

                    Objectives

- Define what a binary heap is
- Compate and contrast min and max heaps
- implement basic methods on heaps
- understand where heaps are used in the reals world and what other data strutures can be constructed from heaps


                What is a Binary HEap

Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules!

in a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larget than child nodes. 
In a MinBinaryHeap, parent node are always smaller than child nodes.
